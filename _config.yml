#           a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.

#           I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things, most recently sockets and Node.JS. I have particually
#           enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.

#           Taken accountability for the frontend of the payments product area within a commercial banking platform, becoming a go to for knowledge and technical decisions.

#           Currently developing a new frontend architecture transforming the current monolithic frontend application into a scalable modular application with micro-frontends
#           using Webpack Module Federation. This has been a great experience to develop a new workflow for developers to develop and release code and have input in all aspects
#           of the development workflow.

#           I have also been a key part of our frontend interview provess, I have worked to improve our interview process including writing new code tests, whilst interviewing
#           candidates across multiple countries.

#           Working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
#           Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
#           work with the PO defining what we are building.

#           I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
#           that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
#           helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.

#           Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
#           be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
#           system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
#           functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.

#           I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within my team and the other teams
#           in the office. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service
#           to the customers while also developing to the highest standards.

#           During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
#           also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
#           workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
#           of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

#           For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
#           600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
#           <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
#           search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
#           communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

#           Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
#           our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
#           our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
#           <mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.

#           While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
#           enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
#           At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
#           such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
#           <mark>Android</mark> applications.

#           During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
#           also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
#           developer.

#           During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
#           great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
#           team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.

#           I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
#           the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.

#           During my degree at Bristol University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
#           we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
#           my advantage in my day to day work.

#           While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
#           as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
#           transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.

#       When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
#       mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
#       rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house
#       and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.

#       I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
#       I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
#       you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).

#       Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
#       Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down 'The Rec' supporting Bath Rugby.
